## Compute iceberg PDFs (spatio-temporal templates) for distributing solid freshwater from land over the ocean in climate models

A Jupyter notebook detailing the process can be found [here](https://github.com/trackow/iceberg-templates/blob/master/compute_iceberg_PDFs_sectorsLONLAT.ipynb). As a next step, another version of the patterns could be based on the modelled meltrates, not just on simple counting of icebergs.


**Ten (ID 0-9) release regions are defined here as follows**. Ice sheets, as in Antarctica, are divided in drainage basins. The IMBIE basins (http://imbie.org/imbie-2016/drainage-basins/) are commonly used. There are differences between basin definitions (http://homepages.see.leeds.ac.uk/~earkhb/Basins_page.html). The most recent version, also known as "IMBIE 2" or "IMBIE 2016" data set, has been defined by E. Rignot, J. Mouginot, and B. Scheuchl (2011a).


*CR's thoughts for the boundaries of the regions (3), (4), (5), (6):*

*(6) Ross Ice Shelf and Basin Dp-E are put together since Dp-E has a low rate according to our former figure. Also in a much colder world, an extended Ross Ice Shelf could be supplied by Dp-E.*

*(5) Since the two regions D-Dp and Cp-D are also characterized by low lost rates, they are combined here, although they could be separated in various very small drainage basins (see "IMBIE 1" drainage basins).*

*(4) Since Amery has been resolved in coarse models, it should be in a "not too large" region.  B-C and C-Cp are put together since they are at -and slightly upstream of- the Kerguelen Plateau. These two regions feed into the Amery Ice Shelf*

*(3) The region Ap-B is at the dynamic coastal current entry to the Weddell Gyre. However, it probably has low calving rates and is clearly upstream of the Kerguelen Plateau.*
